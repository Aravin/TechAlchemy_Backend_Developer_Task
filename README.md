Tech Alchemy Backend Developer Task


## Task 1
You are a developer who accidently went back in time. You can’t return back to your timeline
because you Time machine need to sort array from 10 Gigabytes of unsorted integer data. The
problem in front of you is Machine during that time was not that advanced. You find a device with 1
gigs of ram and 240 Gigabyte of hard drive.
- They are all integers [0,65,535] like 10,5,98,32,22,87,5,6,9 etc.
- Same integer values can be repeatedly appearing in the file.
Create a function to read 10 gigabytes of data and sort it. (Pseudo code and logic will also work)

## Task 2
We are a small startup company which offers the precise and concise news and weather information
to our users. We are not news or weather agency that collects data. We filter the responses from
various sources and show it on our mobile app. We need a backend application which fetches data
from various sources and sends to our user’s phone.
Although we provide weather informations without any authentication but we need authentication
to access news api.
So we implement /signup, /login , logout functionality. You are free to manage user session however
you want
For registration we need user’s email, password and name.
