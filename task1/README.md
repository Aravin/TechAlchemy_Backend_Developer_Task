# Task 1

You are a developer who accidently went back in time. You canâ€™t return back to your timeline
because you Time machine need to sort array from 10 Gigabytes of unsorted integer data. The
problem in front of you is Machine during that time was not that advanced. You find a device with 1
gigs of ram and 240 Gigabyte of hard drive.

- They are all integers [0,65,535] like 10,5,98,32,22,87,5,6,9 etc.
- Same integer values can be repeatedly appearing in the file.

Create a function to read 10 gigabytes of data and sort it. (Pseudo code and logic will also work)
