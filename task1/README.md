# Task 1

You are a developer who accidently went back in time. You canâ€™t return back to your timeline
because you Time machine need to sort array from 10 Gigabytes of unsorted integer data. The
problem in front of you is Machine during that time was not that advanced. You find a device with 1
gigs of ram and 240 Gigabyte of hard drive.

- They are all integers [0,65,535] like 10,5,98,32,22,87,5,6,9 etc.
- Same integer values can be repeatedly appearing in the file.

Create a function to read 10 gigabytes of data and sort it. (Pseudo code and logic will also work)

## Solution

- We can solve this problem using 2 passes.
- In first Pass
  - Possible positive integer values are 2147483647 for 32 bit integer.
  - We have 1GB of RAM and 10GB of Data
  - So, we can divide the integer into block of smaller size. (10 block)
  - Example 0-1GB, 1-2GB and so on.
  - Sort the each block and store it to the File.
- In the second pass
  - Sort Each Block

## Block Size

Array to fit 1GB -> 1 Gigabytes = 1073741824 Bytes

Size of each Array is 4 bytes

So, we can allocate 1073741824 / 4 => 26,84,35,456 size of Array

We can take 80% of Memory => 21,47,48,364 (per iteration)
